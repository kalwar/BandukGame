Introduction:
The game consists of four basic elementsâ€”banduk (gun) that you control, shots fired, the enemy targets, and a blocker element that defends the target. You aim the target by touching the screen. The banduk fires when you double-tap the screen. At the end of the game, the app displays results indicating whether you won or lost, and showing the number of shots fired and the elapsed time.
